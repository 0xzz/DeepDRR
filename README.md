# DeepDRR
Implementation of our early-accepted MICCAI'18 paper "DeepDRR: A Catalyst for Machine Learning in Fluoroscopy-guided Procedures". 
The paper can be accessed on arXiv here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08606

DeepDRR applied to anatomical landmark detection in pelvic X-ray: "X-ray-transform Invariant Anatomical Landmark Detection for Pelvic Trauma Surgery", also early-accept at MICCAI'18: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08608
